# Bridge-Rectifier-Design
A Bridge Rectifier is an electronic circuit used to convert Alternating Current (AC) into Direct Current (DC). It uses four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration to allow current to flow during both halves (positive and negative) of the AC cycle, resulting in full-wave rectification.
